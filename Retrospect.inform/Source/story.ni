[tips
	-Watch plurality when defining objects, check the room description. It seems to be fairly stupid.
			-Fix by stating 'The indefinite article is "".'
	-Only the last statement in conditional blocks has punctuation of *any* kind.
					-Bug?
	-In rules (functions or SR's) Statements ending in a ';' prior to a conditional block generate errors in the 
			compiler if they are followed by a blank line or line with only white space (WTF this took me 20mins to fix)
